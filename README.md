## Game Overview

**Maze Rush** is a time-based maze runner where the objective is simple:  
Navigate through a **randomly generated maze** as fast as you can to locate and **touch the final boss**.

Each run challenges your speed and memory as the maze layout changes, ensuring no two runs are the same.  
After each playthrough, your **most recent time** is displayed — this game is about constant improvement, not chasing an old high score.

## Concept & Background

This project is a spiritual remake of my **first-ever video game**, originally developed during a 48-hour game jam. I wanted to take that concept and rebuild it with more advanced techniques, polish, and procedural systems.

Unfortunately, between a packed academic schedule and work commitments, I wasn’t able to fully realize the initial scope without risking burnout. Instead, I focused on delivering a functional and fun **demo** of the core gameplay loop.

## Notes

This is a personal solo project developed under limited time constraints. Feedback is welcome, and I’d love to expand this further in the future if time allows!
